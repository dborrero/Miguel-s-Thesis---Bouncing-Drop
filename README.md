# On Bouncing Droplets
<b>Advisor:</b> Daniel Borrero

<b>Overview:</b> Here you'll find the work I did for my senior thesis at Reed College. I chose 
to conduct an 
experimental investigation on a "quantum analog", a macroscale fluid system that behaved like a quantum system. Check out the 
full PDF version of the work titled `thesis.pdf`.

<b>Abstract:</b> In 2005 it was discovered that an oil droplet placed on a vibrating bath of the same oil would bounce along the 
surface of the oil indefinitely, propelled by the waves it created. This "walker" exhibits many behaviors 
analogous to those observed in quantum systems, 
such as single particle double slit diffraction, quantized orbits, and among others,
tunneling. Tunneling occurs when a droplet interacts with a submerged barrier; the droplet either passes over or 
reflects off of the barrier. In experiments described here, we study the dependence of the tunneling probability on the height 
of a barrier of width `e` = 3.0 mm. It was determined that tunneling occurred for barriers where the depth of the oil on 
top of the barrier `h` was greater than 1 mm, and showed "quantum-like" probabilistic behavior at an oil depth of 
`h` = 1.25 mm. It was also observed that droplets with higher momentum are more likely to tunnel.
