    \chapter*{Abstract}
	In 2005 Yves Couder's group discovered that and oil droplet placed on a vibrating bath of the same oil would bounce along the surface of the oil indefinitely, propelled by the waves it created \rf{Couder2005a}. This ``walker" exhibits many behaviors found exclusively at the quantum scale, such as single particle double slit diffraction \rf{double-slit}, quantized orbits \rf{Oza2014}, and among others \rf{pilot-wave}, tunneling \rf{tunneling}. Tunneling occurs when a droplet interacts with a surface barrier, through which it can either continue through or be reflected. In this experiment, we adjusted the depth of oil above the barrier to see how it affected the proportion of tunneling events. It was determined that tunneling occurred for depths $h>1.0~\mathrm{mm}$, and appeared probabilistic at an oil depth of $h=1.25~\mathrm{mm}$. It was also shown that droplets with higher momentum are more likely to tunnel.
