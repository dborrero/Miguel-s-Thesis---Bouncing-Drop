    \chapter*{Abstract}
	In 2005 Yves Couder's group discovered that and oil droplet placed on a vibrating bath of the same oil would bounce along the surface of the oil indefinitely, propelled by the waves it created \rf{Couder2005a}. This ``walker" exhibits many behaviors analogous to those observed in quantum systems, such as single particle double slit diffraction \rf{double-slit}, quantized orbits \rf{Oza2014}, and among others \rf{pilot-wave}, tunneling \rf{tunneling}. Tunneling occurs when a droplet interacts with a subsurface barrier; the droplet either passes over or reflects off of the barrier. In experiments described here, we studied the dependence of the tunneling probability on the height of a barrier of width $e=3.0~\mathrm{mm}$. It was determined that tunneling occurred for depths $h>1.0~\mathrm{mm}$, and appeared probabilistic at an oil depth of $h=1.25~\mathrm{mm}$. It was also observed that droplets with higher momentum are more likely to tunnel.
