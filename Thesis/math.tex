\section{Wavefunction}	
In classical mechanics, one can describe a particle with six variables: three position indicators ($x$, $y$, $z$), and three momentum indicators ($p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$). One can find a function to represent variable by making multiple measurements across time, and discover an expression $x(t)$ that describes the particles location in space along the x dimension at time $t$. When all six variables can be described by a function, one can describe the position of the particle at any time.  

In quantum mechanics however, Heisenberg's uncertainty priciple limits the knowledge of position and momentum: 
$$\sigma_{x} \sigma_{p} \geq \hbar/2. $$
This equation states that as one knows more about the position of the system, then one loses knowledge about the momentum of the system, and vis versa. It's a tradeoff inherent to the nature of the system, not due to experimental deficiences. And it means that the strategy of finding equations for position and momentum of a system are no longer possible. If a particle has no exact position, can one represent where it might be? One can use a wave describing the probability of finding the particle at that position. The square root of this wave is called the wavefunction, and is represented by $\Psi(x, t)$.


\section{Schroedinger's Equation}

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

$$E \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$$
