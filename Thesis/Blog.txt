	This is the portion of the thesis that I will update regularly with rough notes, lit reviews, results, etc. that will hopefully all be worked in to the real document after some polishing. 
	
	\section{Literature Reviews}
	
	    \subsection{Particle-wave association on a fluid interface (Protiere 2006)}
	
	    \subsection{Pilot-Wave Hydrodynamics (Bush 2015)}
	    In this meta-analysis, Bush describes some of the characteristics of the bouncing oil drop experiment that are analagous to effects witnessed in the quantum mechanical world (single-particle diffraction, tunneling, quantized orbits, orbital level splitting, and spin states). Dynamics of the walker are described mathematically. Finally, comparisons to de Broglie's orginal formulation of QM (and not Bohm's) and Stochastic Electrodynamics (?) are made. 
	    \subsubsection{Basic Parameters}
	       Consider a fluid of density $\rho$, viscosity $\nu$, and surface tension $\sigma$, in a bath of depth $H$ driven vertically at an amplitude $A_0$ at frequency $f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$. By defining $\mathnormal{\gamma}=A_0\omega^2$, the effective gravity in the frame of reference of the bath is $g+\gamma$. The oil droplet of diameter $D$ bounces in the regime $\gamma<\gamma_F$, where $\gamma_F$ is the Faraday threshold (at this point, Fraday waves appear). The important experimental limits are outlined in Table~\ref{approxlimits}. 
	       
	       	       For certain parameters, the bouncing drop will behave differently. The vibration number $V_i = \frac{\omega}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\rho D^3}{2\sigma}}$ is ``the relative magnitude of the forcing frequency and the drop's natural oscillation frequency." Setting up a plot with $V_i$ on the y axis and $\frac{\gamma}{g}$ on the x axis can help in showing the behavior of the droplet, shown in Fig.~(\ref{regime}).
