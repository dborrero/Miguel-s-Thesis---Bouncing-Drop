\chapter{Experimental Design}
\label{Ch2}

In the bouncing droplet system we observe a unique interaction between a droplet and its wave that showcases various novel behaviors under different circumstances.  In the experiments discussed herein, we will look at how features submerged beneath the surface of the oil affect the motion of the droplet. 

A raised object on the floor of the tray (but still underneath the surface of the oil) can have an effect on height of the surface waves, and thus, on the motion of the walker\rf{tunneling}. Sometimes a droplet headed towards a raised object will be reflected backwards, as if from a collision with the object. For this reason, we refer to a submerged object as a barrier. 

Oftentimes however, the droplet slows down, but continues on and crosses over the barrier without a collision. This is analogous to ``transmission" in the quantum mechanical process of tunneling. For a barrier of a given height and width, there is a probability of tunneling unique to that barrier. Earlier studies have shown that increasing barrier width decreases probability of tunneling\rf{tunneling}. This study looks at how the height of the barrier affects the tunneling probability. 

To test the effect of a barrier's height on the probability of tunneling, I used a combination of procedures from the investigations of Bush et al.~\rf{pilot-wave}, Couder et al.\rf{Couder2005a}, and specifically, Eddi et al.\rf{tunneling}. These were slightly modified to fit some of the unique features of my experiment. In this section, I aim to give some of the reasoning behind the  design of the experimental apparatus and data collection techniques, both of which are not well described in the literature.

\section{Setup}
   To guide the discussion of my experimental design, a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in \refFig{setup} and a picture of the actual setup is shown in \refFig{group}(a). In the experiment, a waveform generator creates a sinusoidal signal which is amplified and fed into a shaker. This signal drives the shaker, which vertically vibrates the tray containing the fluid. Both the frequency and the amplitude of the vertical oscillations can be controlled. An accelerometer records the vertical acceleration of the tray and is read using an oscilloscope. A CCD camera is used to record the droplet as it bounces along the surface of the oil.

\section{Materials}
The key components of this experiment are the shaker, the oil, and the tray. In this section I will describe the specifics of this holy trinity, as well as some of the additional components used in data collection. 

\subsection{Tray}
%The tray's design was based off of the one used by Eddi et al. \rf{tunneling}, which was conducted in a submerged rhombus shape of inner lengths $120~\mathrm{mm}$ by $45~\mathrm{mm}$. The a bath had a total depth $H = 4.1~\mathrm{mm}$, barrier depth $h = 1.1~\mathrm{mm}$, and barriers of width $e = 1.6, 2, 3, 4, 5 $ and $ 6~\mathrm{mm}$.

The tray's design, which was based off of the tray in the tunneling experiment of Eddi et al.\rf{tunneling}, naturally guides the droplet into a perpendicular collision with the barrier. The tray was fabricated from acrylic plastic parts that were cut on the Trotek Rayjet 300 laser cutter in Reed's machine shop. The manufactured components were then glued together with Scigrip Weld-On 3 assembly adhesive.  A detailed schematic of the tray is shown in \refFig{tray}. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

A thin layer of oil spills over the constraining rhombus shape. As long as the layer is thin enough, the droplet will remain in the rhombus container, but the waves will continue to propagate unimpeded. This gives the waves time to decay, meaning that the droplet's motion is not affected by reflections of previous waves from the sidewalls, and is instead guided only by the unreflected waves. The rhombus shape serves to steer the droplet into a perpendicular collision with the barrier. It does this by forcing the droplet to pin-ball into the acute corner of the rhombus so that it shoots out towards the barrier as shown in \refFig{group}(c).

We designed the experiment to test barriers of three different heights: $2.75~\mathrm{mm}$, $3.0~\mathrm{mm}$, and $3.25~\mathrm{mm}$, measured from the bottom of the rhombus. Thin acrylic barriers made by the laser cutter have a tendency to bend and warp over time. To avoid this problem, we made the barriers taller than the specified heights. Then we created a cut-out in the bottom of the rhombus so the barriers could be inserted and held in place by the tight fit. The barrier cut-outs were deep enough to exactly counter the added height of the barrier, so the barriers still had (when measured from the surface of the rhombus) heights of $2.75~\mathrm{mm}$, $3.0~\mathrm{mm}$, and $3.25~\mathrm{mm}$. This design also solved the problem of fixing the barriers in place, while allowing them to be easily removed. The particular heights of the barriers were chosen because they exhibited both transmission and reflection. Other barriers were also made but these were either too tall ($3.5$ and $4.0~\mathrm{mm}$) and blocked all of the droplets, or too short ($1.0$ and $2.0~\mathrm{mm}$) and did nothing to prevent the droplets from crossing over.

In order to improve contrast, the bottom of the tray was painted black, allowing the droplet to be more easily tracked by eye and when using a camera.

\subsection{Silicone Oil}
    Silicone oil was the ideal choice of fluid for this experiment because it remains clean, it has a low vapor pressure (so it does not evaporate), and it can be purchased in a range of specific viscosities. The silicone oil used in this experiment had a viscosity of 20 centistokes (cSt) (its viscosity is a little closer to water than olive oil) and was purchased from Clearco Products Co. Inc., Bensalem PA (CAS No: 63148-62-9). 20 cSt silicone oil, like the one used by Bush et al.\rf{pilot-wave} was chosen because it exhibits walking behavior over a wider range of parameters\rf{pilot-wave} than more viscous oil, such as the 50 cSt viscosity oil used by Couder\rf{Couder2005a}. Depending on the height of the barrier and the desired height of oil above the barrier, the tray requires approximately $18.0~\mathrm{mL}$ of fluid. This volume of oil left a different depth of oil above the barrier, depending on which barrier was in place. For the shortest barrier of $2.75~\mathrm{mm}$, the depth of the oil on top of the barrier was $1.5~\mathrm{mm}$. The intermediate barrier of height $3.0~\mathrm{mm}$ had about $1.25~\mathrm{mm}$ of fluid above it. The tallest barrier at $3.25~\mathrm{mm}$, only had $1.0~\mathrm{mm}$ of fluid on top. The depths of the oil were calculated using the known oil volume and the dimensions of the tray.
    
    It was of vital importance to keep the oil as clean as possible since surface contamination leads to droplet coalescence. This meant protecting the oil from particulate matter that was already in the tray. Contamination was minimized by cleaning the tray before filling it and shielding it from the ambient dust using a plastic shield.
    
\subsection{Shaker}
    To shake the tray, we used a mechanical wave driver made by Pasco Scientific, Roseville CA (model SF-9324). An acrylic component with a set screw was glued to the bottom of the tray. The tray was securely fastened to the thin rod that came on the shaker by tightening the screw.
    
    This shaker is designed to drive a string or an elastic cord, not a $200~\mathrm{gram}$ tray with oil inside. The combined weight of the tray and the oil resulted in a notable decrease in performance after just a couple of minutes of vibration. The initial behavior could be partially recovered after an hour long rest, but after weeks of use there was a noticeable difference. This difference was apparent in the acceleration measurements made by the accelerometer; towards the end of a trial, a signal with a higher amplitude had to be generated to produce the same accelerations measured at the beginning of the trial. For this reason, the shaker was replaced before collecting raw data and was allowed a resting period between trials. The damping of the vibrations also meant that the acceleration signals from the accelerometer had to be continuously  monitored, since the constant signal from the wave generator could not be trusted to produce constant tray vibration. 
    
\subsection{Waveform Generator and Amplifier}
    The shaker was driven with an Agilent Arbitrary Waveform Generator (model 33210). This was controlled digitally and was found to be more stable than other available frequency generators available in the Physics department (e.g. Tektronix CFG280). The waveform generator was usually set to produce a sine wave at $80~\mathrm{Hz}$. The signal from the waveform generator was amplified using a Lepai LP2020A+ digital amplifier, which allowed precise control of the the amplitude of the tray. The signal, which was also monitored with a multimeter, was then fed into the shaker.    
            
\subsection{Accelerometer}  
    As discussed in \refChapter{Ch1}, knowing the tray's acceleration allows us to characterize the behavior of our system. To measure acceleration, we attached an ADXL 326 triple axis accelerometer (made by Adafruit, New York City NY) to the bottom of the tray using screws. This provided a much more secure mount than tape or glue while allowing for removal. The ADXL 326 has a range of $\pm$16$g$, which was ideal for measuring the accelerations in our setup, which were usually below $5g$'s. 
      
      The signal from the z-axis of the accelerometer was measured directly on a Tektronix TDS 2012C oscilloscope. A sample output signal is shown in \refFig{group}(b). For the vibrating tray, the output was approximately sinusoidal (as expected). The manufacturer's specifications for the accelerometer indicate a sensitivity of $57 \pm 6~\mathrm{mV/g}$. 
    
\subsection{Shield}
    A large, see-through cylinder (covered at one end) was manufactured using the laser cutter. When placed over the tray, it served the purpose of keeping the oil clean from particulate matter and preventing air currents from influencing the motion of the walker.       
   
\subsection{Leveling Platform}
    A wooden leveling platform supported the shaker. Three adjustment screws allowed for precise adjustment of the tilt of the apparatus. The alignment of the tray was tuned using a level placed inside the center of the tray (before the oil was added). This was done in order to ensure that the driving acceleration was aligned with gravity.

\subsection{Camera}       
 
To document trials, we used a Canon EOS Rebel T5i DSLR camera supported on a tripod and aimed directly down at the tray. Attached to the camera was a Canon 18-135 mm lens. Set in its Tv configuration (Time Value -- allows for shutter control) and in video mode, the 18 megapixel image could be optically zoomed and manually focused on the bouncing droplet. Other settings were left on automatic.

\section{Procedure}
Once the desired driving parameters were established (frequency and driving amplitude) so that walking behavior was observed, tunneling measurements at a few different barrier heights were made. These procedures are outlined in more detail below.

\subsection{Finding the Walking Regime}

Before investigating the rate of tunneling using different barriers, a rough estimate of the walking regime at a frequency of $80~\mathrm{Hz}$ must be made. Using \refFig{regime} as a guide for finding the walking parameters, an estimate of $\gamma_\mathrm{F}$ and $\gamma_\mathrm{W}$ was made. These values were expected to be slightly different from those found in the literature due to the slightly different height, tray, oil, and shaker configurations.

Droplet size is measured using a recorded video of the walking droplet in motion. By comparing the number of pixels making up the diameter of the droplet, which is unknown, to the number of pixels making up the known length of the diagonal of the rhombus, we can estimate the length associated with each pixel, and thus find the diameter of the droplet in millimeters. For accurate droplet diameter measurements, a mean value composed of 9 separate  droplet diameter measurements per trial was computed. The droplets were found to have diameters on the order of $1.0~\mathrm{mm}$, as discussed in \refSect{parameters}. 

Driving acceleration values was measured by the accelerometer and displayed on the oscilloscope. To keep the acceleration constant throughout a measurement, the amplitude of the signal coming into the shaker was continuously adjusted in order to counteract the damping introduced as the shaker warmed up.

To ensure that every trial has the same oil depth, we measured the volume of oil ($18.0~\mathrm{mL}$) before filling the tray using a $25~\mathrm{mL}$ graduated cylinder with $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ graduation. Knowing the volume of the tray and of each barrier, we could calculate a value for the oil depth without interfering with the system. In this way, oil depth above the barrier ($1.5~\mathrm{mm}$ for the $2.75~\mathrm{mm}$ barrier, $1.25~\mathrm{mm}$ for the $3.0~\mathrm{mm}$ barrier, $1.0~\mathrm{mm}$ for the $3.25~\mathrm{mm}$ barrier) could be made constant between trials. 

\subsection{The Experiment}

This experiment utilized data collected from 3 independent trials. A trial consisted of measuring tunneling behavior for three different barrier heights using a single droplet. At each height (and at a constant frequency of 80 Hz and constant tray acceleration), a string of collisions were filmed with the camera. Between each measurement, the barriers had to be removed and replaced while the tray was still shaking in order to keep the droplet from coalescing. Since the size of the droplet changes its walking behavior, it was important to maintain a constant droplet diameter to allow for accurate comparisons between barrier heights. Not having a droplet of the same size is a major limitation to most of the research in the bouncing droplet system, such as in the other tunneling experiments \cite{tunneling}, and the fact that we were able to keep ours constant is a great success. To maintain a constant memory, $\gamma_\mathrm{F}$ was measured for each system, and the value of $\gamma$ was adjusted such that the $\gamma/\gamma_\mathrm{F}$ memory value stayed the same between barriers. From the collected data, a fraction of transmissions per total collisions was calculated, which provides the most simplistic tunneling analysis of this system. 

The tray was designed such that most of the droplet's collisions with the barrier occur ``head on" (i.e. perpendicular to the length of the barrier), but not all collisions unfold ideally. A more involved analysis using \textit{Tracker} used the component of velocity of the droplet in the direction perpendicular to the barrier to determine the probability of tunneling given this value. Since not all collisions in the simplistic analysis occurred at the same velocity, the perpendicular velocity method provided a more refined analysis of the phenomenon.
