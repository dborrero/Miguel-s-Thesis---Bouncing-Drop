  Abstract                 = {Yves Couder, Emmanuel Fort, and coworkers recently discovered that a
millimetric droplet sustained on the surface of a vibrating fluid bath may
self-propel through a resonant interaction with its own wave field. This article
reviews experimental evidence indicating that the walking droplets exhibit
certain features previously thought to be exclusive to the microscopic,
quantum realm. It then reviews theoretical descriptions of this hydrodynamic
pilot-wave system that yield insight into the origins of its quantumlike
behavior. Quantization arises from the dynamic constraint imposed
on the droplet by its pilot-wave field, and multimodal statistics appear to
be a feature of chaotic pilot-wave dynamics. I attempt to assess the potential
and limitations of this hydrodynamic system as a quantum analog.
This fluid system is compared to quantum pilot-wave theories, shown to
be markedly different from Bohmian mechanics and more closely related to
de Broglie's original conception of quantum dynamics, his double-solution
theory, and its relatively recent extensions through researchers in stochastic
electrodynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {A droplet bouncing on a vibrated bath becomes a ``walker" moving at constant velocity on the interface
when it couples to the surface wave it generates. Here the motion of a walker is investigated when it
collides with barriers of various thicknesses. Surprisingly, it undergoes a form of tunneling: the reflection
or transmission of a given incident walker is unpredictable. However, the crossing probability decreases
exponentially with increasing barrier width. This shows that this wave-particle association has a nonlocality
sufficient to generate a quantumlike tunneling at a macroscopic scale.},
